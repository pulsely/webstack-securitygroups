__Security Groups Webstack__ is a Django powered webstack solution developed by [Pulsely](https://www.pulsely.com/). 
__Security Groups Webstack__ let you control the access of a specific Security Group in an Amazon Web Services Virtual Private Network.

## Running the Security Groups Webstack

You can run the Security Groups Webstack directly with a Python virtual environment, or with Docker.

### Running with Python Virtual Environment

The best way would be to create a new Python virtual environment. Any Python with version 3.9 should work.
The only dependency would be an active Redis 4.0+ installation.

* Pull the source code of Job Hunting Webstack:
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/pulsely/webstack-securitygroups
  ```

* Changed to the directory of the Job Hunting Webstack:
  ```sh
  cd webstack-securitygroups
  ```

* Create a new python virtual environment and install the packages from requirements.txt:
  ```sh
  python -m venv venv
  source ./venv/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
(Your Python 3 runtime could be named differently, such as 'python3', so change to ```python3 -m venv venv``` if this is the case.)

* Then run the Security Groups Webstack:
  ```sh
  python manage.py runserver
  ```
  The manage.py will check if a .env file is create and create one for you automatically if missing. The db.sqlite3 file will also be created for you 4 seconds after the installation is fired up the first time.
* You can run your Security Groups Webstack in development mode with the Make command ```make dev```, or activate the venv virtual environment created previously with these commands:
  ```sh
  source ./venv/bin/activate
  python manage.py runserver
  ```


### Running with Docker

The Security Groups Webstack has a default DockerFile which will run with Docker or Podman in development mode.

* The Docker setup will run the Security Groups Webstack with Django, and run the first run setup automatically.

  ```sh
  docker-compose up
  ```

* To run the Docker setup in daemon mode:

  ```sh
  docker-compose up -d
  docker-compose run django python manage.py createsuperuser
  ```

## Special notes on deployment

If you deploy to production such as Nginx with Supervisord, you will need to overwrite the default ``CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`` variable at the file ``securitygroups/settings_customized.py``.

Configuration details of the ``CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`` is available at [Django website](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/settings/#csrf-trusted-origins)

---

## Django Management Commands



Type ```python manage.py``` to check for the default Django management commands available:

```
migrate
createsuperuser
changepassword
```

```python manage.py migrate``` will create database schema on your database settings. It should automatically run by manage.py the first time though.

```python manage.py createsuperuser``` allows you to create superuser at the command line.

```python manage.py changepassword``` let you change password for any user in the system.

These Job Hunting Webstack commands are available for testing and house cleaning.
```
mail_test
reset
```

```python manage.py mail_test``` can be used for sending test e-mail(s) to check your notification configurations.

```python manage.py reset``` will remove the .env, db.sqlite3, celerybeat-schedule and jobhunting/settings_customized.py configuration files to reset your installation.   
**(Only available for DEBUG mode on.)**

## Running databases other than SQLite?

You can use any databases supported by Django. Create the database settings at the jobhunting/settings.py file following the Django documentations, and you should be good to go.
